<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<p>Hi, I'm João Roberto, I'm 22 years old, and I live in Maricá, Rio de Janeiro. Currently, I work in the IT department at the city's Department of Education. My role there is to ensure that all sectors related to education run smoothly without technological interruptions. I provide user support, maintain software and computers, manage networks, and am also responsible for overseeing the IT infrastructure.</p>

<p>My passion for technology has always been a part of my life. Since childhood, I've been immersed in this world, exploring computers, cell phones, projectors, and other tech devices. The feeling of understanding how things work and how we can use them to make people's lives easier has always fascinated me. It's this passion that drives me to pursue software development. I have a strong desire to create programs that not only meet needs but also enhance the user experience. Seeing something I developed being used in everyday life is, to me, an indescribable feeling.</p>

<p>Although I work in IT, my greatest ambition is to become a developer, creating innovative and useful solutions. The idea of working more independently, with the flexibility of having my own home office, is what appeals to me the most. Working with technology is my passion, and being able to do it from a comfortable environment and at my own pace would be the fulfillment of a dream.</p>

<p>I'm a homebody, enjoy spending time with my wife, and my life is focused on the routine of work, studies, and our shared time together. Amid all of this, I continue to dedicate myself to learning more about technology and development, always striving to grow professionally to achieve my goals.</p>
